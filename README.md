## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend tooling
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

---

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me understand how to handle:

- Deployment of Vite apps to GitHub Pages using `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
- Dynamically applying background images in styled-components with imports.
- Handling focus states and keyboard accessibility with React hooks.
- Validating user input and providing instant feedback using styled-components and React state management.

---

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to:

- Improve animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
- Implement a more robust form validation system with libraries like `yup` or `react-hook-form`.
- Explore using TypeScript for better type safety and improved developer experience.
